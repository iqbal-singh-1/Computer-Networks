# Networking

- A network is a collection of devices interconnected with each other to perform various functions like sharing data, hardware, and sometimes they can even act as a server to provide services to clients.
- Think of a network like a group of people assembled together to play a football match, play a game, or do studies. Every person has their specific role in the network. For example, in a football team, each player plays at a specific location on the ground and is assigned a specific role. A player might be a defender, a goalkeeper, or an attacker. 
- Similarly, in a network, different devices have different roles depending on the needs.

## Why Learn Networking?

- Networking is the basis of Cyber Security. To defend ourselves from hackers, we must know which network we are connected to, how to block that network from unauthorized access, and much more.
- Since a network links multiple devices, it becomes easier for a hacker to gain unauthorized access if they are knowledgeable about exploiting the network's security vulnerabilities.
- Other practical examples include gaming, social media, education, geo-location, and more.
