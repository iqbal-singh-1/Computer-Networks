# Types of Networks

There are basically two types of network architectures:

1. **Client-Server Architecture**
    - This type involves two sides: the client and the server.
    - The client refers to a person or device that requests information, while the server is the entity that provides that information to the client.
    - In this architecture, the server-side computers are generally more powerful and have greater resources compared to the client computers.

2. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**
    - In this network architecture, mutual exchange of data occurs, meaning each device can act as both a server and a client.
    - There is no hierarchy among the computers; each device has equal status.
    - An example of a peer-to-peer network is sharing files from one PC to another via Bluetooth or a USB drive.
    - A well-known example of peer-to-peer technology is blockchain.

## Based on the Scale of Network

We can divide networks into three types:

1. **LAN (Local Area Network)**
    - A local area network or LAN is defined as a network that manages a small number of devices.
    - The cost of setting up a LAN is usually low compared to other types of networks.
    - The speed of data transfer is high, and latency is low.
    - The devices used include computers, printers, scanners, routers, switches, etc.
    - However, one main concern is that the security may not be very robust, which can be an issue.

2. **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**
    - A MAN is defined as a network that spans a large area, such as a city or a town.
    - The cost of setting up a MAN is higher compared to LAN, and the setup is more complex.
    - The speed of data transfer is typically lower than that of LAN, and latency may also be higher.
    - The major benefit is that it covers a larger geographic area.

3. **WAN (Wide Area Network)**
    - A WAN is defined as a network that is larger than a MAN and covers a larger geographical area compared to other networks.
    - It uses technologies like satellites and microwaves to exchange data between devices.
    - WANs use a large number of protocols to manage the network.
    - Communication is usually done through wireless mediums.
    - A major advantage is the high amount of information available and the possibility of remote access to the network.
    - Examples include calling systems, FM radio, and TV channels.
